Grading Notes/Group Dynamics
Each member of the group is individually responsible for having a working application.  Group members are expected to work together towards this common goal.  If a group is having a problem with a member, the instructor must be notified right away.  Start this early, as soon as the first week, if a member is not cooperating or is out of contact.  Scores are assigned individually and the instructor will assign differentiated scores based on feedback from members.  Note: It is in your best interest to work together and log all attempts you make to contact members who are not helping.
